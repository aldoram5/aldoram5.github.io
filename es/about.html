                            <p> En 2012, yo(Aldo Pedro Rangel Montiel), funde Crimson R Games.
                                Empezó como un simple blog(con tecnología Blogger) con algunos articulos relacionados con 
                                programación, videojuegos y sistemas. Desde entonces le he ido agregando más contenido
                                como tutoriales de tecnologías que he usado o que me parecen interesantes, también he 
                                publicado información de proyectos en los que he trabajado o que son enteramente mios.
                                <br>
                                Más recientemente en 2017, he comenzado a utilizar Crimson R Games como la marca detrás 
                                de mis juegos y aplicaciones. Además he comenzado a usar este sitio como un portafolio 
                                del algo del trabajo que he hecho y también como mi blog de desarrollador.<br>

                                <p>¡Hola! Mi nombre es Aldo Pedro Rangel Montiel, soy un desarrollador con una ardiente
                                    pasión por la creación, diseño y desarrollo  de juegos y applicaciones.
                                    Decidí ser un programador cuando ten&iacute;a 6 años, inspirado por el juego de
                                    Super Nintendo "Super Mario World"; ese juego me fascino por la variedad en sus niveles, 
                                    la jugabilidad entretenida y que me daba la oportunidad de explorar un mundo mágico desde la pantalla del televisor.
                                    De ahí comenzo mi deseo de poder crear mundos como ese por mi mismo. Ahí fue cuando mi mamá 
                                    me  explicó que los programadores eran quienes podían crear esos coloridos mundos.
                                    Since then I was eager to learn how to program, however I didn't had a computer
                                    until I was 13, but it was a very old machine with Windows XP,
                                    which could barely run Word, so I really couldn't use it.<br>
                                    Then when I started the high school(2008) I finally acquired what I see
                                    as my first own computer, a Compaq Pressario laptop and with it 
                                    I learned how to program. The high school(IPN CECyT 9), 
                                    at third semester made me choose a technical specialty of the 3 available:
                                    Digital Systems, Machines with Automated Systems and Programming. I decided
                                    to chose Programming and there I learned Object Oriented Programming with java
                                    and then in later semesters I tried in many projects for the school
                                    other technologies such as PHP, SOAP services, MySQL and Javascript.<br>
                                    However I still hadn't had the chance to develop a game of my own, I experimented
                                    a bit with Game Maker lite and also with the SDL library but I really didn't finish 
                                    anything, until in 2012 when I participated in the BlackBerry Challenge, which 
                                    rewarded you with a Blackberry Playbook if you could finish a game or app for 
                                    the Blackberry Appworld. Then I dedicated to finally make my very own first Game, 
                                    the game's name is The Chronicles of Magastria: The Training. I made everything in that game
                                    the music, the sprites, etc. This one was really hard because I had to code a some sort of 
                                    grafical engine using opengles 1.0 with C. Right now you won't be able to
                                    find it because I withdrawed it from the Blackberry Appworld, because it crashed sometimes near the 10th level.
                                    While I fixed the errors it had I decided not to upload it again mostly because 
                                    I became aware of other more successful platforms: Android & iOS. Later that year I got my 
                                    current part time job in a company named GBMobile.</p><p>
                                    There I had the opportunity to hone my skills
                                    and also learned a lot specially about mobile development. While working there, I was involved 
                                    in the making of many apps(internal and also ones that got published in their respective stores)
                                    and one game named Zombitlan, which helped me to learn a lot about Unity 3D, and thanks to the apps
                                    I've been working on there I learned Android development(both with de SDK and NDK with Android Studio)
                                    and iOS development(Xcode). Also during the development of an app named Keyron I came in cotact with 
                                    Computer Vision and learned about a very good library named OpenCV, which I've been exploring since then.
                                    While working on all of that in my laboral hours in my spare time I developed Colorful Tiles, which was my 
                                    first Android game, however it hasn't been really successful, but it was my second personal project
                                    that I was able to complete and thanks to it I learned a lot mor about Unity and the whole publishing process.
                                    After that one I created an app, again only for the Android platform, mostly because back in that time 
                                    I didn't had a MAC which is necessary for iOS development. That App was for a Co-Worker which was a student like
                                    me, but her computer broke and because she needed to learn more about HTML5 and javascript for school and work,
                                    I developed the Simple HTML Tester for her, and then I decided to upload it to Google Play as well, mostly because
                                    it could help others as well, and it seems it has, because right now, it is my most successful app.
                                    Thanks to all that experience I have been able to keep up Crimson R Games, now as the brand behind the apps
                                    I've developed and the ones that are yet to come.
