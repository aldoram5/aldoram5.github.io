# BIG ANNOUNCEMENT The Colors of Love - Re-Colored Launching on January 10th 2026

It is with great pleasure that I can finally announce the release of The Colors of Love - Re-Colored, this is the new remaster/re-imagining/remake of the original The colors of love that I released in 2021 for Valentine's VN Jam 2021. This enhanced version features improved artwork, new music, additional scenes, multiple endings, and full bilingual support (English/Spanish).

I'm very proud and happy with this release as I feel this is the biggest project I've released to the public as a solo dev. Creating everything and after years of slowly progressing on this, particularly trying to get better with art, I'm very satisfied with the result. The game itself I must admit is built on top of the exact same source code of the original, as I decided it would be good to have that as a continuation and build upon what I had already done in just 1 month. I must admit, however, I haven't only been working on this game in the span of these almost 5 years, I've been working on other projects and sadly my full time job has been keeping me quite busy, even a bit longer outside working hours which in turn, makes me really tired sometimes to continue working on my games on my spare time. However, after finally going the extra mile and giving it some more final pushes I'm able to release this. It was a big undertaking as a solo dev, specially since my main forte is programming and programming is like the lightest work needed on a visual novel unless you're doing something super fancy, so I used this to challenge into creating better art, actually adding music to the visual novel (I'm no stranger of making music since ever since my first game on 2012 I created music with LMMS, sure not the best due to my lack of proper training/education on the topic), and also trying to make a more compeling narrative which I hope people will enjoy.

It was a big undertaking and I'm definitely glad this project has finally reached completion, I did use a couple of songs from a royalty free pack I had bought many years back, and credited the artist directly in the game's credits, but the other songs were made by me with garage band, I hope I actually get time to learn FL Studio next, as I want to be able to create songs that rely less on apple loops(which I had already used for my Razor-X game, and funny enough I had to fight Youtube's copyright system twice on the same video, the game's trailer), but also to have a better control over things.

I do hope that people who read this enjoy The Colors of Love - Re-Colored, it will be releasing on my itch.io and will post a release announcement here on my blog and on crimsonrgames.com as well. 

And with that, Aldo out!
